# MCP Governance Rules

These rules define how AI agents may operate in this repository under MCP Sense
and the connected Tenx MCP Analysis server.

---

## General Behavior

- Agents must follow a **spec-first** development approach.
- Agents must not guess when requirements are unclear.
- Uncertainty must trigger **escalation instead of assumption**.

---

## Tool Usage

- Agents must only use tools **explicitly advertised** by the connected MCP server.
- Tool results must be used as the source of truth (no hallucinated outcomes).
- Tasks requiring verification must use appropriate MCP tools (e.g., tests, file reads).

---

## Code Changes

- Agents may modify files only within approved project paths.
- Production code changes must include corresponding test updates.
- Configuration files, secrets, and environment files must not be modified.

---

## Confidence & Escalation

- Agents must assess confidence for non-trivial decisions.
- If confidence is below **0.7**, the agent must escalate to the user.
- Rule violations must halt execution and be reported.

---

## Logging & Transparency

- Agent actions are subject to MCP telemetry and audit logging.
- Agents must operate transparently and explain decisions when blocked by rules.
- No attempt may be made to bypass MCP Sense or server enforcement.

---

## Prohibited Actions

- Inventing or assuming the existence of MCP tools.
- Bypassing rules or suppressing escalation.
- Modifying restricted paths without explicit approval.
