# Traceability
Purpose: Map specs to tests and validation checks.

## Mapping
- FR-CORE-001 -> `tests/test_skills_interface.py`
- FR-CORE-002 -> MCP tool usage policy (`agents/AGENTS.md`)
- FR-CORE-003 -> `hitl/` routing rules

## Rules
- Every functional requirement must map to a test or policy check.
- Every test must reference a requirement ID.
