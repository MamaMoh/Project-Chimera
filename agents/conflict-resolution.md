# Conflict Resolution
Purpose: Define precedence rules for agent disagreements.

## Precedence Order
1. AGENTS.md policies
2. Legal and platform constraints
3. SRS and spec requirements
4. Planner acceptance criteria
5. Worker execution preferences

## Tie-Break Rules
- Safety wins over performance.
- Compliance wins over growth.
- Human reviewer wins over Judge on edge cases.

## Dispute Workflow
1. Identify the conflicting rule or output.
2. Compare against precedence order.
3. If unresolved, escalate to HITL with a short summary.
